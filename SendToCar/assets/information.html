<p>This app lets you send an address from Google Maps directly to the navigation system of your vehicle so you don't have to manually type it in.  This functionality exists in the web version of Google Map, but not in the Android version. This app brings the Send To Car feature to Android.  To see if your car is supported in your country, visit Google Maps on your desktop.</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>Start the Google Maps app on your Android device. Search or select a destination point on the map. Click the bubble to view details about the point. At the bottom of the details page, select "Share this place". In the list of possible actions, select "Send to Car".</p>
<p>Once the address has been loaded by Send To Car, select your vehicle make and the account identifier (this could be the user name you use to log in to your vehicle manufacturer's web portal or your mobile phone number).</p>
<p>If you want, you can edit the name of the destination before sending it.</p>
<p>Then click the "Send" button and away it goes!</p>
